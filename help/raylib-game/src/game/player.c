    player->moveSpeed = 0.1f;
    player->turnSpeed = 0.003f;

}

void UpdatePlayer(Player *player) {
    // Handle player movement and jumping logic here
    // Example: Update player position based on input
}

void DrawPlayer(Player player) {
    // Draw the player model at the player's position
    DrawCube(player.position, 1.0f, 1.0f, 1.0f, BLUE);
